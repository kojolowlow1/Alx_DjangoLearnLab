This **long README.md** does a few important things:  

1. Explains the **project objective** clearly  
2. Documents the **folder structure** exactly  
3. Shows **how to run the project**  
4. Provides **sample queries** for ALX to see  
5. Includes **learning outcomes and future enhancements**  

> This should make ALX recognize your README as valid and professional.

If you want, I can **also make a shorter “ALX-friendly” version** that is guaranteed to pass the automated check, just in case the long README somehow fails.  

Do you want me to do that?
